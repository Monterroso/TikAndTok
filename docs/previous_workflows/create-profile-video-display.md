Phase 1: Data Integration
1. [ ] Utilize Existing User Data Services:
[ ] Review and document existing user data fetching methods
[ ] Verify streamUserProfile and getUserProfile functionality
[ ] Test error handling for non-existent users
[ ] Add proper type definitions for user data if missing
2. [ ] Implement User Data Caching:
[ ] Create a cache mechanism in FirestoreService
[ ] Define cache expiration strategy
[ ] Add cache hit/miss logging for debugging
[ ] Test cache with multiple video loads
Phase 2: UI Updates
[ ] Update CreatorInfoGroup:
[ ] Create new data model for creator info props
[ ] Add loading skeleton UI for profile picture
[ ] Add loading skeleton UI for username/title
[ ] Implement error state UI
[ ] Test each UI state independently
[ ] Update VideoFeed:
[ ] Modify constructor to accept full video objects
[ ] Create a video data provider/controller
[ ] Implement user data prefetching for next videos
[ ] Add proper dispose cleanup for data streams
[ ] Test with different video/user combinations
Phase 3: Integration
[ ] Update Video Model:
[ ] Add user data field to Video class
[ ] Update fromFirestore factory
[ ] Add user data fetching method using existing services
[ ] Test with actual Firestore data
[ ] Modify FrontPage:
[ ] Update StreamBuilder to handle full video objects
[ ] Implement error boundary widget
[ ] Add retry mechanism for failed user data fetches
[ ] Test error recovery scenarios
Phase 4: Testing & Verification
[ ] Component Testing:
[ ] Test user data fetching with various network conditions
[ ] Verify cache behavior with multiple videos
[ ] Test memory usage with large video lists
[ ] Verify proper cleanup of resources
[ ] UI Testing:
[ ] Test loading states visibility
[ ] Verify smooth transitions between videos
[ ] Test error state recovery
[ ] Verify proper display of all user data fields
[ ] Performance Testing:
[ ] Measure and optimize user data fetch times
[ ] Monitor memory usage during scrolling
[ ] Test cache hit rates
[ ] Verify smooth scrolling with full data
