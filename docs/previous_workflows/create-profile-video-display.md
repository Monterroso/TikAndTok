Phase 1: Data Integration - Existing Functionality
1. [✓] User Data Services Already Implemented:
   - [✓] `streamUserProfile` in FirestoreService for real-time user data
   - [✓] `getUserProfile` for one-time fetches
   - [✓] Error handling for non-existent users
   - [✓] Type definitions in User model
2. [✓] Profile Picture Handling:
   - [✓] `uploadProfileImage` in FirebaseStorageService
   - [✓] `getProfilePictureUrl` for fetching URLs
   - [✓] `deleteProfilePicture` for cleanup
   - [✓] Error handling and validation

Phase 2: Required Updates for Video Display
1. [ ] Update VideoFeed Component:
   - [ ] Modify to accept full Video objects instead of just URLs
   - [ ] Pass current video data to CreatorInfoGroup
   - [ ] Add prefetching for next video's creator data
   - [ ] Implement proper cleanup on dispose

2. [ ] Enhance CreatorInfoGroup:
   - [ ] Add Video and User model props
   - [ ] Use existing streamUserProfile for creator data
   - [ ] Implement loading states using existing patterns
   - [ ] Add error handling for failed data fetches
   - [ ] Reuse profile picture loading logic

Phase 3: Integration with Existing Components
1. [ ] Video Model Integration:
   - [✓] Video model already includes:
     - [✓] userId for creator reference
     - [✓] title and description fields
     - [✓] proper Firestore conversion
     - [✓] URL validation
   - [ ] Add user data caching strategy

2. [ ] FrontPage Updates:
   - [✓] Already implemented:
     - [✓] Video streaming from Firestore
     - [✓] Error handling
     - [✓] Loading states
     - [✓] URL validation
   - [ ] Required changes:
     - [ ] Pass full video objects to VideoFeed
     - [ ] Update CreatorInfoGroup positioning
     - [ ] Add video metadata display

Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
1. [ ] Component Testing:
   - [ ] Test user data fetching with existing services
   - [ ] Verify profile picture loading
   - [ ] Test error recovery using existing handlers
   - [ ] Verify proper cleanup of resources

2. [ ] UI Testing:
   - [ ] Test loading states with existing patterns
   - [ ] Verify smooth transitions
   - [ ] Test error state recovery
   - [ ] Verify all user data fields display correctly

3. [ ] Performance Optimization:
   - [ ] Implement caching strategy using existing services
   - [ ] Monitor memory usage
   - [ ] Test scrolling performance
   - [ ] Optimize image loading

Key Benefits of Using Existing Components:
1. Consistent User Data Handling:
   - Reuse proven profile data fetching methods
   - Maintain consistent error handling
   - Leverage existing caching mechanisms

2. Profile Picture Management:
   - Use existing image upload and URL fetching
   - Reuse cleanup mechanisms
   - Maintain consistent error handling

3. UI Consistency:
   - Reuse loading state patterns
   - Maintain consistent profile display
   - Leverage existing error UI components

4. Data Validation:
   - Use existing URL validation
   - Maintain consistent data structure
   - Leverage existing type checking

Next Steps:
1. Begin with VideoFeed modifications
2. Update CreatorInfoGroup
3. Implement caching strategy
4. Add performance optimizations

This implementation plan leverages our existing functionality while minimizing new code and maintaining consistency across the application.
