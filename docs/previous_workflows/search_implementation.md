# Search Implementation Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding search functionality to our TikTok clone application. The goal is to create a functional and performant search feature that allows users to find videos and creators quickly, while maintaining the ability to extend functionality in the future.

## Design Goals
- Create an intuitive search experience
- Leverage existing components and patterns
- Maintain performance with real-time updates
- Build with extensibility in mind
- Keep implementation straightforward for MVP

## MVP Features

### 1. Core Search UI
- Real-time search with 300ms debounce
- Minimum 2 characters to trigger search
- Sectioned results view
- Reuse existing video grid/feed patterns
- Loading states and error handling

### 2. Search Results Sections
#### Videos Section
- Display first 5-10 results in grid format
- Search by video title
- "See All" expansion to full feed view
- Reuse existing `VideoGrid` component
- Basic pagination (10-15 items per page)

#### Users Section
- Display first 5 results
- Search by username/display name
- Simple profile card design
- Basic pagination on expansion

#### Recent Searches
- Store locally using SharedPreferences
- Display last 5 searches
- One-tap to repeat search
- Simple clear history option

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```dart
// Search Result Types
enum SearchResultType {
  video,
  user,
  recentSearch,
}

// Search State
class SearchState {
  final String query;
  final bool isLoading;
  final String? error;
  final List<Video> videoResults;
  final List<User> userResults;
  final List<String> recentSearches;
}
```

### Controller Pattern
```dart
class SearchController extends ChangeNotifier {
  // Core search functionality
  Future<void> search(String query)
  
  // Section-specific loading
  Future<List<Video>> loadMoreVideos()
  Future<List<User>> loadMoreUsers()
  
  // Recent searches management
  Future<void> addRecentSearch(String query)
  Future<void> clearRecentSearches()
}
```

### Firestore Queries
- Basic text matching for initial implementation
- Index on video titles and usernames
- Simple pagination using `startAfter`

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Search
1. Create search screen with basic UI
2. Implement search controller
3. Add real-time video results
4. Setup basic error states and loading

### Phase 2: Enhanced Results
1. Add user search results section
2. Implement "See All" expanded views
3. Add pagination to both sections

### Phase 3: Recent Searches
1. Add local storage for recent searches
2. Implement recent searches UI
3. Add clear history functionality

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Tags system for improved search
- Trending searches/tags
- Advanced filters (date, likes, etc.)
- Server-side search history
- Enhanced search algorithms
- Category-based filtering

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Debounce search input (300ms)
- Limit initial results per section
- Implement pagination for expanded views
- Cache recent searches locally
- Optimize Firestore queries with proper indexes

### UI/UX
- Clear loading states
- Smooth transitions between views
- Error handling with retry options
- Empty state handling for each section
- Clear feedback for search progress

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for SearchController
2. Widget tests for search UI components
3. Integration tests for Firestore queries
4. Performance testing for real-time updates

## Dependencies
- Existing `VideoGrid` and `VideoFeed` components
- Firestore for data queries
- SharedPreferences for local storage
- Provider for state management

## Rationale for Design Choices

### Why Real-time Search?
- Provides immediate feedback
- Feels more responsive and modern
- Similar to TikTok's implementation
- Easy to implement with debounce

### Why Local Recent Searches?
- Simpler implementation than server-side
- Reduces server load
- Provides immediate access to history
- Easy to clear/manage

### Why Sectioned Results?
- Better organization of different content types
- Allows for section-specific optimization
- Easier to extend with new section types
- Familiar pattern from other apps

### Why Reuse Existing Components?
- Maintains consistency
- Reduces development time
- Leverages tested code
- Familiar patterns for maintenance

## Success Criteria
- Search returns relevant results within 500ms
- UI remains responsive during search
- Recent searches persist between sessions
- Error states are handled gracefully
- Pagination works smoothly in expanded views

## Rollback Plan
- Each phase can be rolled back independently
- Recent searches can be cleared if corrupted
- Search can fall back to basic functionality
- UI can degrade gracefully if features fail

This implementation plan provides a solid foundation for search functionality while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. The focus on MVP features ensures we can deliver a working solution quickly while setting up for future improvements.
