# Updated Login/Signup and Main Page Checklist

This document outlines all tasks to implement the login/signup flow and a basic main page with logout functionality. The following checklist is fully compliant with our internal documentation, the latest Firebase best practices, and our overall project architecture.

---

## 1. Firebase Project & Configuration Setup

- [x] **Project Creation & Authentication Methods:**
  - Confirm that the Firebase project is created.
  - Enable Email/Password and Google sign-in in the Firebase console.

- [x] **Configuration Files:**
  - Update `android/app/google-services.json`.
  - Update `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`.
  - Verify that `ios/Runner/Info.plist` contains the URL scheme (using `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID`) for Google sign-in.

---

## 2. Dependency Configuration

- [x] **Update Dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:**
  - Add `firebase_core: ^2.24.2`
  - Add `firebase_auth: ^4.15.3`
  - Add `google_sign_in: ^6.1.0`
  - Add `provider: ^6.0.5`
  
  **Note:** These specific versions are known to work together. If you encounter version conflicts, these are the recommended versions to use.

- [x] **Retrieve Dependencies:**  
  Run:
  ```bash
  flutter pub get
  cd ios
  pod install
  cd ..
  ```

## 3. Firebase Initialization

- [x] **Initialize Firebase Before App Starts:**
  - In `lib/main.dart`, mark `main()` as `async`
  - Call `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before initializing Firebase
  - Await `Firebase.initializeApp()` before calling `runApp()`
  - Added Provider setup for authentication state management
  
  **Implementation Notes:**
  - Firebase initialization is done using the generated `DefaultFirebaseOptions`
  - Authentication state is managed using `StreamProvider<User?>` from the `provider` package
  - Added `AuthWrapper` widget to handle conditional rendering based on auth state
  - Next steps will involve creating the `LoginScreen` and `HomeScreen` widgets

## 4. Auth Service Implementation

- [x] **Centralized Authentication Service (`lib/services/auth_service.dart`):**
  - Implemented the following methods:
    - ✅ `Future<UserCredential> signInUser({required String email, required String password})`
    - ✅ `Future<UserCredential> signUpUser({required String email, required String password})`
    - ✅ `Future<UserCredential> signInWithGoogle()`
    - ✅ `Future<void> signOutUser()`
  - Each method includes:
    - ✅ Rigorous error handling with specific `FirebaseAuthException` codes
    - ✅ Clear error messages for each failure case
    - ✅ Proper async/await usage
  - Additional features:
    - ✅ Implemented as a singleton for consistent state
    - ✅ Added email verification after sign-up
    - ✅ Added password reset functionality
    - ✅ Added auth state stream and current user getters

- [x] **Consistency:**  
  All authentication operations are routed through `AuthService` using the singleton pattern.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Used singleton pattern to ensure single instance throughout the app
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for all Firebase Auth exceptions
- Added password reset functionality for better user experience
- Included proper cleanup in sign out (both Firebase and Google Sign In)
- Added documentation for all public methods

## 5. Login/Signup Page Creation

- [x] **Screen Setup (`lib/screens/login_screen.dart`):**
  - **Form Fields:**
    - ✅ Added `TextFormField` for email with validation
    - ✅ Added `TextFormField` for password with validation and visibility toggle
  - **Form Management:**
    - ✅ Using `GlobalKey<FormState>` for form validation
    - ✅ Added controllers for email and password fields
  - **Authentication Buttons:**
    - ✅ Implemented Sign In/Sign Up toggle functionality
    - ✅ Added Google Sign In button
    - ✅ Added Forgot Password button
  - **User Feedback:**
    - ✅ Added loading indicator during async operations
    - ✅ Implemented error handling with SnackBar messages
    - ✅ Added form validation feedback
  - **State Management:**
    - ✅ Proper loading state handling
    - ✅ Clean disposal of controllers
    - ✅ Safe state updates with mounted checks

**Implementation Notes:**
- Used StatefulWidget for proper state management
- Implemented toggle between login and signup modes
- Added password visibility toggle
- Included password reset functionality
- Added proper keyboard types for form fields
- Implemented comprehensive error handling
- Used proper Flutter form validation patterns
- No manual navigation needed (handled by AuthWrapper)

---

## 6. Main Page with Logout Functionality

- [x] **Screen Creation (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`):**
  - **UI Setup:**
    - ✅ Added user profile section with avatar and user info
    - ✅ Added email verification status and resend option
    - ✅ Added placeholder for future video feed content
    - ✅ Added logout button in app bar
  - **Logout Handling:**
    - ✅ Implemented logout functionality using `AuthService.signOutUser()`
    - ✅ Added proper error handling for logout
    - ✅ Navigation handled by AuthWrapper
  - **Authentication State Tracking:**
    - ✅ Using Provider to access current user state
    - ✅ Displaying user information from Firebase Auth
    - ✅ Showing verification status for email users

**Implementation Notes:**
- Used Provider to access user information throughout the screen
- Added visual feedback for unverified email addresses
- Implemented resend verification email functionality
- Created a clean, modern UI with proper spacing and organization
- Left placeholder for future video feed implementation
- Proper error handling with SnackBar messages

---

## 7. Routing and Navigation

- [X] **Define Clear Navigation Routes:**
  - Configure routes in `main.dart` or within a dedicated routing file.
  - Ensure that the navigation flow adheres to our architecture:
    - Successful login moves to the main page.
    - Logout returns the user to the login page.

---

## 8. Testing & Verification

- [X] **Email/Password Flow:**
  - Test the sign-in and sign-up processes with valid inputs.
- [x] **Google Authentication Flow:**
  - Validate that Google sign-in works correctly and the necessary configuration files are current.
- [X] **Logout Flow:**
  - Verify that clicking the logout button properly signs out the user and navigates back to the login screen.
- [X] **UI & Error Handling:**
  - Ensure loading indicators and error messages are appropriately displayed during async operations.

---

## 9. Documentation & Inventory Updates

- [X] **Feature Inventory:**
  - Update `docs/feature_inventory.md` to reflect the new login/signup and main page features.
- [X] **Development Guidelines:**
  - Document any changes or additional practices in `docs/development_guidelines.md`.

---

## 10. Cross-Reference with Architecture Documentation

- [X] **Review Compliance with `docs/architecture.md`:**
  - Confirm that the project structure and directory usage (services, screens, widgets) align with our architectural patterns.
  - Verify state management with Provider follows our guidelines.
  - Check that service layer components (e.g., `auth_service.dart`) are properly encapsulated and used throughout the app.
  - Ensure navigation and routing flows are consistent with the architecture overview.
