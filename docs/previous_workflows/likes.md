# Video Like Feature Implementation Workflow

Phase 1: Data Structure & Model Updates
1. [✓] Current Implementation Review:
   - [✓] Video model has likes field
   - [✓] Basic video stats update functionality exists
   - [✓] UI placeholder in right_actions_column.dart with like/dislike buttons
   - [✓] Basic count display structure

2. [ ] Update Video Model:
   - [ ] Add likedBy field as a Map<String, bool> in Video class
   - [ ] Update fromFirestore and toFirestore methods
   - [ ] Add isLikedByCurrentUser helper method
   - [ ] Update documentation
   - [ ] Remove dislike-related fields if present

Phase 2: Firebase Integration
1. [ ] Firestore Service Updates:
   - [ ] Add toggleLike method:
     ```dart
     Future<void> toggleLike({
       required String videoId,
       required String userId,
     })
     ```
   - [ ] Implement transaction for atomic updates:
     - Update likedBy map
     - Update likes count
   - [ ] Add streamVideoLikes method for real-time updates
   - [ ] Add error handling and logging
   - [ ] Remove any dislike-related functionality

2. [ ] Security Rules:
   - [ ] Update Firestore rules to allow authenticated users to:
     - Read like status
     - Toggle their own likes
     - View like counts

Phase 3: UI Implementation
1. [ ] Create Like Animation Widget:
   - [ ] Create lib/widgets/video_viewing/like_animation.dart
   - [ ] Implement TikTok-style double-tap heart animation:
     - Scale animation (pop effect)
     - Fade out animation
     - Particle effects (optional)
   - [ ] Add haptic feedback

2. [ ] Update RightActionsColumn:
   - [ ] Replace existing like/dislike buttons with single heart icon
   - [ ] Update _ActionButton to handle only likes
   - [ ] Integrate real-time like status
   - [ ] Add double-tap gesture detection
   - [ ] Implement optimistic updates:
     - Instant UI feedback
     - Fallback on error
   - [ ] Add loading states
   - [ ] Error handling with user feedback

Phase 4: Integration
1. [ ] Video Feed Integration:
   - [ ] Pass video and user data to like widget
   - [ ] Handle like status updates
   - [ ] Implement double-tap gesture detection
   - [ ] Add proper cleanup in dispose

2. [ ] State Management:
   - [ ] Use StreamBuilder for real-time updates
   - [ ] Handle optimistic updates
   - [ ] Manage loading states
   - [ ] Error recovery

Phase 5: Testing & Validation
1. [ ] Unit Tests:
   - [ ] Test toggleLike method
   - [ ] Test like count updates
   - [ ] Test error scenarios

2. [ ] Widget Tests:
   - [ ] Test like animation
   - [ ] Test double-tap detection
   - [ ] Test UI state updates

3. [ ] Integration Tests:
   - [ ] Test real-time updates
   - [ ] Test error recovery
   - [ ] Test animation performance

Phase 6: Documentation
1. [ ] Update Architecture:
   - [ ] Document like data flow
   - [ ] Update Video model section
   - [ ] Add new components
   - [ ] Remove references to dislike functionality

2. [ ] Update Feature Inventory:
   - [ ] Mark like feature as complete
   - [ ] Document known limitations
   - [ ] Remove dislike feature from inventory if present

3. [ ] Code Documentation:
   - [ ] Add comments to new methods
   - [ ] Document animation parameters
   - [ ] Add usage examples

Phase 7: Deployment
1. [ ] Pre-deployment Checks:
   - [ ] Verify security rules
   - [ ] Test on multiple devices
   - [ ] Performance profiling

2. [ ] Monitoring Setup:
   - [ ] Add logging for like operations
   - [ ] Monitor Firestore usage
   - [ ] Track error rates

Next Steps:
1. Begin with Video model updates and removal of dislike functionality
2. Implement Firestore service methods
3. Create animation widget
4. Update existing RightActionsColumn UI

Questions or Clarifications Needed:
- Confirm animation style preferences
- Discuss error handling strategy
- Review security rule requirements
- Confirm if any existing dislike data needs to be cleaned up
