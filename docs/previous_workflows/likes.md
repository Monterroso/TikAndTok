   - [ ] Test toggleLike method
   - [ ] Test like count updates
   - [ ] Test error scenarios

2. [ ] Widget Tests:
   - [ ] Test like animation
   - [ ] Test double-tap detection
   - [ ] Test UI state updates

3. [ ] Integration Tests:
   - [ ] Test real-time updates
   - [ ] Test error recovery
   - [ ] Test animation performance

Phase 6: Documentation
1. [✓] Update Architecture:
   - [✓] Document like data flow
   - [✓] Update Video model section
   - [✓] Add new components
   - [✓] Remove references to dislike functionality

   - [ ] Performance profiling

2. [ ] Monitoring Setup:
   - [ ] Add logging for like operations
   - [ ] Monitor Firestore usage
   - [ ] Track error rates

Implemented Features:
1. Like/Unlike Interactions:
   - Double-tap anywhere on video to toggle like status
   - Click heart button to toggle like status
   - Heart animation appears at double-tap location
   - Haptic feedback on interactions

2. Real-time Updates:
   - Immediate UI feedback with optimistic updates
   - Firestore integration for persistence
   - Error handling with UI recovery

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Efficient Set-based like tracking
   - Optimistic updates for responsive UI
   - Proper cleanup and state management

Next Steps:
1. Implement comprehensive test suite
2. Complete deployment checklist
3. Set up monitoring and analytics

Known Limitations:
- Animation only shows when liking, not unliking
- Double-tap areas might overlap with other interactive elements
- Need to verify performance with large user bases

Questions or Clarifications Needed:
- Confirm animation style preferences
- Discuss error handling strategy
- Review security rule requirements
- Confirm if any existing dislike data needs to be cleaned up
